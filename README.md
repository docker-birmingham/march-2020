A Brief History of Containers - Richard Horridge
------------------------------------------------------------------

A review of how the containerisation technology has progressed since its inception (while trying not to be too academic!)


Richard Horridge is currently a research student in the Birmingham
Centre for Railway Research and Education, specialising in digital
systems, intelligent infrastructure, condition monitoring and
sensor fusion.

Say Yes! to K8s in Docker - Matt Todd
----------------------------------------------------------

Apparently the container orchestrator war has been won (cough, cough betamax, cough, cough VHS etc) with K8s's fist being held high in victory. So you want some of that action, but don't want to shell out for a Cloud managed KaaS (!) service such as EKS and need a local service for local people. This talk will provide an overview of solutions for running certified K8s distributions in Docker and evaluating the pros and cons of each.

Matt Todd is BlackCatâ€™s Chief Architect and Technologist, where he helps their clients create and execute technology and data strategies that solve complex business problems. He started out almost twenty years ago studying AI and is stunned by the changes in the field, its positive and negative impacts on our lives and where it's all going next!

Matt has remained an active member of the Birmingham technology scene and set up the Birmingham Docker and Cloud Native MeetUps and is a regular speaker and host at their events.

He loves a good strong flat white, weird tasting beer in cans and strange electronic music from the 90s.

Hope to see you there!
